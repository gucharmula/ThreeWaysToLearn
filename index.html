  const content = "An essential element of 10 PRINT is randomness; the program could not produce its mesmerizing visual effect without it. This randomness comes by way of RND, a standard function in BASIC. RND has been part of the BASIC lexicon since the language’s early days at Dartmouth. What the function does is easily characterized, yet behind those three letters lie decades, even centuries, of a history bound up in mathematics, art, and less abstract realms of culture. This chapter explores randomness in computing and beyond. The role of randomness in games, literature, and the arts is considered, as are the origins of random number generation in modern mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Also discussed is the significance of “pseudorandomness”—the production of random-like values that may appear at first to be some sad, failed attempt at randomness, but which is useful and even desirable in many cases. The chapter argues that the maze pattern of 10 PRINT is entwined with a complex history of aesthetic and utilitarian coin flips and other calculations of chance. Since a random occurrence is “hap,” the root of happy, it might seem that “random” would have a happy etymology. But this is not so. In centuries past, before the philosophers and mathematicians in the Age of Enlightenment sought to rationalize chance, randomness was a nightmare. Likely ancestors of the word “random” are found in Anglo-Norman, Old French, and Middle French and include randoun, raundun, raundoun,
randon, randun, and rendon—words signifying speed, impulsiveness, and violence. These early forms are found beginning around the twelfth century and probably derive from randir, to run fast or gallop (“random, n., adv., and adj.” 2011). Bumper stickers implore drivers to “practice random acts of kindness,” but only because people in our culture fear random acts of violence so much that this phrase has become ingrained and can be punned upon—and at a deeper level, perhaps, because the speed and violence of other vehicles are to be feared. While in recent days it might be harmless to encounter “a random” sitting in the computer lab exploring a system at random, a “random encounter” centuries ago was more likely to resemble a random encounter in Dungeons & Dragons: a figure hurtling on horseback through a village, delivering death and destruction. Only recently have the meanings of the word “random” coalesced around science and statistics. The history of this word is strewn with obsolete meanings: the degree of elevation of a gun that maximizes its range; the direction of a metallic vein in a mine; the sloping board on the top of a compositor’s frame where newly arranged pages are stored before printing. These particular randoms kill opponents, create wealth, or help assemble texts. The RND command in 10 PRINT selects one of two graphical characters—a kind of textual composition that recalls the last of these meanings of random. 10 PRINT’s random is a flip or flop, a symbol like a slash forward or backward (but fortunately less fearsome than the horseman’s random slash). The program splays each random figure across the screen using the PRINT command, another echo of the printing press and a legacy of the early days of BASIC, when PRINT literally meant putting ink on paper. Although RND on the Commodore 64 may seem remote from these early meanings of “random,” there are, beneath the surface, connections to speed, violence, devastation, and even printing. Games of Chance Life itself is full of randomness and the inexplicable, and it is no small wonder that children and adults alike consciously incorporate chance into their daily lives, as if to tame it. Games of chance are one of the four fundamental categories of games that all humans play, according to the French cultural historian Roger Caillois. Whereas agon are competitive games dependent upon skill, games of mimicry are imaginative, and ilinx are games causing disorder and loss of control, the alea are games of chance. Craps, roulette, the lottery—these are some of the games in this category, ones with unpredictable outcomes. Taken from the Latin name for dice games, alea “negates work, patience, experience, and qualifications” (Caillois 2003, 17) so that everything depends on luck. In Latin, the aˉleaˉtor is a gambler; in French, aléatoire is the mathematical term for random. The Appeal of the Random In his Arcades Project on nineteenth-century Paris, Walter Benjamin devotes an entire section to dice games and gambling, a curious assemblage of notes and excerpts from sources ranging from Casanova to Friedrich Engels. “Gambling,” Anatole France is quoted as saying, “is a hand-tohand encounter with Fate” (Benjamin 1999, 498 [O4A]). Every spin of the roulette wheel is an opportunity to show that fate smiles upon the player. Fortunes rise and fall in the blink of an eye, the roll of the die, or the cut of the cards. Every gambler knows this, accepts it, and even relishes it. The allure of gambling—and more generally, the allure of chance in all games—rests on uncertainty. Uncertainty is so compelling that even otherwise skill-based games usually incorporate formal elements of chance, such as the coin toss at the beginning of a football game. As Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman put it, uncertainty “is a key component of meaningful play” (2004, 174). Once the outcome of a game is known, the game becomes meaningless. Incorporating chance into the game helps delay the moment when the outcome will become obvious. Consider the case of George Hurstwood in Theodore Dreiser’s Sister Carrie, first published in 1900. Driven by “visions of a big stake,” Hurstwood visits a poker room: Hurstwood watched awhile, and then, seeing an interesting game, joined in. As before, it went easy for awhile, he winning a few times and cheering up, losing a few pots and growing more interested and determined on that account. At last the fascinating game took a strong hold on him. He enjoyed its risks and ventured on a trifling hand to bluff the company and secure a fair stake. (Dreiser 1981, 374) What is intriguing about Dreiser’s account is that it is only when Hurstwood’s good fortune wavers that his interest in the game grows and he begins to enjoy it. Losing a few hands makes a winning streak that much more thrilling. “A series of lucky rolls gives me more pleasure than a man who does not gamble can have over a period of several years,” Edouard Gourdon avers in one sexually charged extract in the The Arcades Project. “These joys,” he continues, “vivid and scorching as lightning, are too rapid-fire to become distasteful, and too diverse to become boring. I live a hundred lives in one” (Benjamin 1999, 498 [O4A]). Unlike the early, purely malevolent associations of randomness described in the beginning of this chapter, randomness here involves the masochistic interplay between pleasure and pain. There is also a monumental compression of time: a hundred lives in one. Anatole France calls gambling “the art of producing in a second the changes that Destiny ordinarily effects only in the course of many hours or even many years” (Benjamin 1999, 498 [O4A]). Benjamin himself declares that “the greater the component of chance in a game, the more speedily it elapses” (512 [O12A,2]). Waiting, boredom, monotony—these frustrations disappear as “time spills from hi [the gambler’s] every pore” (107 [D3,4]). Forms of Randomness Perhaps Benjamin describes games of chance with a bit more whimsy than is useful for critical discussion of the role of randomness in culture. Although words like randomness, chance, and uncertainty may be casually interchanged, not all forms of chance are actually the same. To highlight distinctions between various forms of chance, consider the anthropologist Thomas Malaby’s account of gambling in a small Greek city on the island of Crete—an appropriate site of exploration, given alea’s Greek etymology. Malaby’s goal is to use gambling as a “lens through which to explore how social actors confront uncertainty in . . . key areas of their lives” (2003, 7). How do people account for the unaccountable? How do we deal with the unpredictable? And what are the sources of indeterminacy in our lives? Malaby presents a useful framework for understanding indeterminacy based on four categories. The first category is formal indeterminacy, or what is commonly referred to as chance. This is any form of random allotment, which often can be understood and modeled through statistical methods. Malaby argues that the ascendancy of statistical thinking in the social sciences has so skewed our conception of indeterminacy in gambling (in particular) and in our lives (in general) that formal indeterminacy has become a stand-in for other types of indeterminacies. The second category is social indeterminacy, the impossibility of knowing or understanding someone else’s point of view or intentions. A bluff is a type of social indeterminacy. The third category is performative indeterminacy, that is, the unreliability of one’s own or of another’s actions, say a fumble in football game or misreading the information in plain view on a chessboard. Finally, the fourth category Malaby describes, cosmological indeterminacy, refers to skepticism about the fairness and legitimacy of the rules of the game in the first place at a local, institutional, or cosmological level. Suspicion that a game is rigged, for example, is concern about cosmological indeterminacy (Malaby 2003, 15–17). Privileging of the stochastic principles of formal determinacy means that players, scholars, and even programmers dismiss social and performative indeterminacies altogether. In the case of 10 PRINT, thinking about social indeterminacy can reveal several new layers of randomness, such as the idiosyncratic line numbers in the 1982 and 1984 versions of the program. Likewise, understanding performative indeterminacies may account for the textual variants of the program, for example, the version that appeared in the online publication Commodore Free that will not actually execute as printed (Lord Ronin 2008). Cosmological indeterminacy is perhaps the most difficult form of indeterminacy to apply to 10 PRINT. The rise of the scientific method can be seen as one enduring struggle to impose a more rational view upon the world and to abolish cosmological indeterminacy. From Aristotle to Galileo to Newton, classical mechanics defined the universe as an organized system without random actions. Einstein declared that “God does not play dice with the universe.” Yet, as a closer examination of randomness on the Commodore 64 will reveal, there is evidence that randomness on this computer—and indeed, on any computer—is fundamentally “rigged” in a way that echoes Malaby’s idea of cosmological indeterminacy. Randomness and chance operations are so necessary to daily life, well beyond the realm of games, that randomness itself is framed as fixed, repeatable, and knowable"
