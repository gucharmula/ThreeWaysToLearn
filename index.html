  const content = "An essential element of 10 PRINT is randomness; the program could not produce its mesmerizing visual effect without it. This randomness comes by way of RND, a standard function in BASIC. RND has been part of the BASIC lexicon since the language’s early days at Dartmouth. What the function does is easily characterized, yet behind those three letters lie decades, even centuries, of a history bound up in mathematics, art, and less abstract realms of culture. This chapter explores randomness in computing and beyond. The role of randomness in games, literature, and the arts is considered, as are the origins of random number generation in modern mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Also discussed is the significance of “pseudorandomness”—the production of random-like values that may appear at first to be some sad, failed attempt at randomness, but which is useful and even desirable in many cases. The chapter argues that the maze pattern of 10 PRINT is entwined with a complex history of aesthetic and utilitarian coin flips and other calculations of chance. Since a random occurrence is “hap,” the root of happy, it might seem that “random” would have a happy etymology. But this is not so. In centuries past, before the philosophers and mathematicians in the Age of Enlightenment sought to rationalize chance, randomness was a nightmare. Likely ancestors of the word “random” are found in Anglo-Norman, Old French, and Middle French and include randoun, raundun, raundoun, randon, randun, and rendon—words signifying speed, impulsiveness, and violence. These early forms are found beginning around the twelfth century and probably derive from randir, to run fast or gallop (“random, n., adv., and adj.” 2011). Bumper stickers implore drivers to “practice random acts of kindness,” but only because people in our culture fear random acts of violence so much that this phrase has become ingrained and can be punned upon—and at a deeper level, perhaps, because the speed and violence of other vehicles are to be feared. While in recent days it might be harmless to encounter “a random” sitting in the computer lab exploring a system at random, a “random encounter” centuries ago was more likely to resemble a random encounter in Dungeons & Dragons: a figure hurtling on horseback through a village, delivering death and destruction. Only recently have the meanings of the word “random” coalesced around science and statistics. The history of this word is strewn with obsolete meanings: the degree of elevation of a gun that maximizes its range; the direction of a metallic vein in a mine; the sloping board on the top of a compositor’s frame where newly arranged pages are stored before printing. These particular randoms kill opponents, create wealth, or help assemble texts. The RND command in 10 PRINT selects one of two graphical characters—a kind of textual composition that recalls the last of these meanings of random. 10 PRINT’s random is a flip or flop, a symbol like a slash forward or backward (but fortunately less fearsome than the horseman’s random slash). The program splays each random figure across the screen using the PRINT command, another echo of the printing press and a legacy of the early days of BASIC, when PRINT literally meant putting ink on paper. Although RND on the Commodore 64 may seem remote from these early meanings of “random,” there are, beneath the surface, connections to speed, violence, devastation, and even printing. Games of Chance Life itself is full of randomness and the inexplicable, and it is no small wonder that children and adults alike consciously incorporate chance into their daily lives, as if to tame it. Games of chance are one of the four fundamental categories of games that all humans play, according to the French cultural historian Roger Caillois."
